# Twitter Science Classifier

Twitter doesn't have a science topic and I think that's bullshit.  I spend way too much time on twitter.  And I would like to have my life back.  But also, I really like the content people share.  So I don't want to stop getting that content.

Therefore, I'm left with only one recourse - I must grab all the content twitter _would_ show me.  And then keep the content that is science related.  Then I can read it when and _if_ I want to and not feel the fear of missing out.
